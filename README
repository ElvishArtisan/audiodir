AudioDir is a CGI script that can be used to insert information dynamically
from audio file metadata (such as that contained in MP3 files) into web
pages by means of a server side include (SSI).

Invocation:
<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/audiodir.cgi?Key=[name]&Filter=[filter-spec]&SortBy=[sort-spec]&Format=[fmt-string] -->

where:
[name] - The name of the location, as defined in the '/etc/audiodir.conf' file.

[file-spec] - The file spec of the files to be used to generate metadata,
              relative to the location of the SSI call --e.g. '*.mp3'.

[sort-spec] - A string to define how the metadata list should be sorted, using
              the letter part of the metadata wildcards (see below).  For
              example, a sort-spec of 'm/d/y' would cause the listing to
              be sorted by the modification date of each respective file.
 
[fmt-string] - A template defining how the metadata listing for each
               file matching [file-spec] should be rendered.  The following
               wildcards cards are available:
